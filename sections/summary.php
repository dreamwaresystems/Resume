		<h3>About myself</h3>
		
		<?php
		/*
			<p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
				
				During my ten years of professional experience as a software engineer, I have gained proficiency across a wide range 
				of languages and architectures – from low-level C/C++ trading tools to PHP/Java web applications and more recently, 
				native iOS and Android mobile app development.  In an industry that completely reinvents itself every two years; I have 
				found the ability to adapt to be invaluable, and my breadth of experience instrumental in avoiding common pitfalls, 
				scalability issues and stack oversights.  
				
				<br /><br />
				
				For the past eight years I have become increasingly versed in mobile app development, designing over a dozen native 
				iOS and Android apps grossing over 3-million combined downloads.  I am proficient in Objective-C as well as Swift 4  
				and have spent the past month familiarizing myself with the latest advances in Swift 5.  
				
				<br /><br />
				
				A bit more extroverted than your typical engineer, I often find myself mentoring fellow developers, conveying 
				plans to management and leading my dev teams to exceed expectations.  I pride myself on my ability to communicate 
				not only with developers but with clients and less technical members of the business world alike. 
				
				<br /><br />
				
				I am currently looking for a lead iOS role with an innovative tech company or startup but I am always open to new adventures. Full-stack and growth 
				opportunities would not be frowned upon.   A friendly company culture and a challenging mission are more important to me than any specific 
				industry or product.

			Remaining on the cutting edge of an industry that completely reinvents itself every two years is what gets me 
			out of bed in the morning ...and occasionally wakes me up at 4AM in a cold sweat - but that's what makes it fun! 
			
			Given the protean nature of software design, I have found my ability to adapt to be invaluable and my 
			breadth of experience; instrumental, in avoiding common pitfalls and nascent stack limitations.  
			
			<br><br>
			Holding a dual degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I have spent a large portion of my career 
			working in finance, converting theoretical models and forecasting engines into practical software applications. 
			Through self-education and personal challenges, I am continuously adopting new technologies and 
			methods in order to build better, more elegant software solutions and more importantly, to bring those solutions 
			to market before that rogue fifteen-year-old genius operating out of his mom's basement beats us all to it...

			not only with developers but also with clients and less-technical members of the business qqqqq. All said, 
			I am a programmer at heart and writing code has been a passion of mine ever since I compiled my first "bug-riddled" 
			lines of BASIC in third grade.
			<br><br>
			I am always learning, always networking and always open to new opportunities.
